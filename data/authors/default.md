Hey there. I'm **Bala**, currently a final year student at **Multimedia University, Cyberjaya**. Apart from that, I'm all over the place. I'm currently an AI Engineer at [Tapway](https://gotapway.com/) where I'll be working on building and scaling their no code AI platform as a part of the MLOps team. Previously I worked as a Research Assistant at [ViPr Lab](https://github.com/viprlab), Multimedia University, working on applied deep learning problems on image emotions and aesthetics. I worked at [ParcelDaily](https://parceldaily.com) where I wore many hats, but specifically I wore the Backend Engineer hat more often for over two years and scaled the system from prototype stage to 20,000 users and redesigned the system to be able to handle 100k+ users and 10k+ requests per minute. While I was an intern at a company back in 2020, I built and delivered a video CMS system called [PrestoColor](https://www.prestocolor.online/video-cms-and-player) (I'm particularly proud of this one because I learned a lot lol.). I'm also active in my university community where I was Vice President of [IT Society, MMU](http://itsociety.rocks/) and as part of it I planned and executed, and led a team of 30 people to organize the first ever National level programming competition and hackathon by Multimedia University, [Codenection 2021](https://www.facebook.com/CodeNection/) (Next year I joined as a participant and got second place in national finals). I led the sponsorship team in [Barcamp 2021](https://barcampcyberjaya.org/), and the [Backend API](https://github.com/anirbanpranto/barcamp-2021-api) along with my friend Shaun Mak (I love you Shaun). Currently working on writing an interpreter for Lox language in C++.
