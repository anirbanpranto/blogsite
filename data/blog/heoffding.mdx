Imagine you have 1 coin and you toss it 10 times. What is the probability of having 10 heads? Well, in a fair coin toss, it should be very low.
For 1 coin toss, the probability is $\frac{1}{2}$, for 10 coin tosses it multiplies with itself, so the answer is, $(\frac{1}{2})^{10} \approx{0.1}$, now suppose you know someone who got 10 heads in a coin toss
and you hypothesize that their coin is biased. But is it really? It can really just be a coincidence. Let's say probability of
