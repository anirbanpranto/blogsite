# Life before

I grew up in a very nice neighborhood, in a very nice school, one of the best ones from where I am. I met people from all walks of life in there, people from all backgrounds.
People I had almost nothing common with, I grew up with a lot of them. But in the entirity of my childhood, and half of my teenage, I could not relate to them. I didn't have much
of a social life, I didn't have dreams, ambitions or interests, I just followed what other's did. I had no sense of individuality. I don't really remember much of my life, but I know
that I spent all of those years mimicking others. I hanged out with cool kids, and did what they thought to be cool. But one day, something cool happened, and it pretty much changed me overnight.

# Life in the middle

When I was 16, I moved away from my parent's house to a different place, a whole different country to attend university. I didn't know much about anything, I didn't even know why I chose the major I chose.
All I knew was, we make video games. I liked to play video games, I spent countless hours in my childhood playing them. So I enrolled into a Computer Science school. I wasn't that serious about it either.
But, something happened, all of a sudden I was good at things. I started liking computers, I started liking what goes undernith the hood of all the software that runs in our computers.

But I was still the same kid, relying on others too much, not having any individuality, not having much of my own opinions. I just wanted to blend in. But, only difference now was, they didn't know that I am trying to blend in (Or maybe they did, who knows(?)).
I was the cool and smart kid. Kids would be talking to me because they knew that I know things that they don't. They would ask me to be in the same assignment group with them because that for sure is an A+. I tried
to please them, doing all the work myself, so that they don't stop appreciating me. I always had this feeling that I had to do things for others for them to like me. But cool thing about this is, I learned a lot of computer Science
to keep up with ever growing expectations of people. Over time, I slowly but surely realized, I finally have an interest, I code. (Say it in Ryan Gosling Voice - "I drive"). At 18 year of age, I finally knew, I am one of those computer
nerds that they show in TV.

# Life moves fast

Pandemic, RIP. I got detached from the people in school and went to complete isolation. This is when I realized, I don't really need people. All I need is my computer and all I need is to do things I like.
Sure, I had no friends (No money, No b\*tches), but damn, I had stuff to do. I got my first job, at 18, I started working at a tech startup. This is the first time, I could freely do something I liked. I could interact with people that
are very much like me. I could communicate well, I could give my own opinions. It created a different kind of confidence in me. I was finally at home somehow. I learned how to step up and give my own opinions, how to even oppose opinions of
others. Because, software engineering was the only thing in my life up until that point that I chose myself.

My communication skills grew a lot, I was able to talk to people by myself, and approach them even. It was great. But the problem is, I got too consumed into the software life. It became part of my personality.
(software engineer btw, I use Arch (btw) btw, I code in neovim (btw)). But as a side effect, I also started to make a lot of friends who are just like me, so we got along fine. Just a bunch of people doing better than their peers, people
who make a lot of money, people who like to boast how smart they are in front of others, people who are overachievers. I was still trying to blend in.

But in middle of all this, I forgot, why I was here, and how I got here. I forgot the joy of striving to create something good, the joy of being able to solve extremely hard problems. I stopped trying harder to become better. I simply stopped trying.

# It moves even faster downhill

All of a sudden, I didn't have much of any purpose in my life anymore. I started just doing things that are convenient for me, and wasting my time on things that I didn't enjoy. I stopped
working on cool side projects, stopped learning new things constantly. While, compared to my peers, I was already ahead in almost every metric, I was still very far from where I set out to be.
School wasn't interesting anymore because it didn't teach me anything new, it was just tedious b\*tch work, and I barely wanted to put up with any of it. But somehow, none of that even occur to me.
I was just doing all the tedious work at my job, half assing school and being a douchebag all day. I was resisting learning, and changing.

# I met someone

So, I met someone. None of your business who. I have been the douchiest bag to her all the time. When I first talked to her, I tried to impress her by telling her how high my iq is, and how good my grades are and that I'm a software engineer (btw).
That went on for some time (like for a year). I was still the same douchebag. But, she was there, and she had been a great friend. She is different from me, she has interests, she has things that she enjoys, her personality is not based on how good she is at something.
Her personality is unique. She taught me how there are joy in simplest things. Things like that were incomprehensible for me though. Its very hard for me to understand how she can be so chill about everything, how can she not take life so seriously like I do. She taught me how its fine to just do your own stuff for your own sake.
She taught me that I don't have to do things for people to make them stay in my life, I can just be myself. I still don't understand her fully, I still get super serious about silly things, and like an average software engineer, I try to map life as an agile sprint and micromanage everything. But well, I think I can try to be better.
We're like polar opposites (Pic related)

# What the f\*ck was the point of that previous paragraph?

Well, she made me realize, "What the f\*ck am I doing with my life?", I have strayed too far from what I set out to do. I just wanted to have fun and enjoy changing lives. I started taking life too seriously and I started thinking myself to be better than everyone else (I am btw), but
I forgot that, I still have a long way to go. Ffs I'm 21, I have a lot to learn and lot to see. I have a newfound interest in creating and learning new things again. I have an open mind to learn new things.
I now remember once again that, I am here to write great software and bring changes to lives.

Happy coding!
