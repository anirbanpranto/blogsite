# Life Lately

Life lately hasn't been very good. I have been slowly losing my focus, energy and determination to work. I don't know what happened to me,
for once I used to be very motivated and productive. I've been losing myself in thought of others, crippling depression has been killing me.
So, I decided today, this has to change. I'm 20, and life has just started. I cannot lose myself at such a young age, I must go on. I'm eagerly
waiting for my university to open in May, so that I can finally breath some fresh air. Meanwhile I plan to fix my life by -

- Exercising regularly.
- Eating in time.
- Practicing Leetcode.
- Maintaining a Diary and a Todolist and get work done immidiately when I get work.
