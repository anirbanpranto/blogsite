# Life Lately

Life lately hasn't been very good. I have been slowly losing my focus, energy and determination to work. I don't know what happened to me,
for once I used to be very motivated and productive. I've been losing myself in thought of others, crippling depression has been killing me.
So, I decided today, this has to change. I'm 20, and life has just started. I cannot lose myself at such a young age, I must go on. I'm eagerly
waiting for my university to open in May, so that I can finally breath some fresh air.

# Life Onwards

I feel like I have been really risking my career and progress in thought of others. This is not something desired, I need to separate my
identity as an individual and focus on things that matter. I cannot control everything, life cannot be optimized. So, I should just spend
time on things that I can control. My health, academics and career. These can only be done with -

- Exercising regularly.
- Eating in time.
- Practicing Leetcode and spending time on learning theory.
- Maintaining a Diary and a Todolist and get work done immidiately when I get work.

Things that I look to accomplish in upcoming days -

- Brushing up on my math and ML theory
- Making ML projects, and preparing for research
- Making engineering projects (tooling I think)
- Going on hackathons
- Learning DP, Trees and Graphs better
